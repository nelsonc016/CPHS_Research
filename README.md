# CPHS_Research
This is a research project analyzing the academic performance of students within the Chicago Public School System.
The goal of this project was to analyze and research the academic performance of students using compostite ACT scores
as our primary indicator and using factors such as attendance, suspension rates, and the different school types to determine
academic performance. This project was constructed and established on R/R-Studio and used data in the form of a csv file.
